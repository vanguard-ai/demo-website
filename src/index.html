                  <span id="outputContent">The claim that "neuste studien zeigen das der Mietendeckel funktioniert" (latest studies show that the mietendeckel works) is not entirely accurate according to the evidence available. There have been mixed findings from various studies on the effects of the rent control policy in Berlin. While some studies have found positive effects such as the decrease in rents by an average of 8% in Berlin, other studies have found negative effects, including a decrease in the supply of rental housing and an increase in rents for new apartments.

Therefore, it is important to conduct further research and consult trusted sources to fully understand the impact of the mietendeckel before making any conclusive statements on its effectiveness. As of now, the policy remains controversial and has been declared unconstitutional by Germany's Federal Constitutional Court. </span>

                  <span id="outputContent">According to the evidence presented, it appears that there is support for the claim that the rent cap in Berlin does not work. Several studies, including those by the ifo institute, pwc, and immoscout24, have found that the rent cap did not have a significant impact on rental prices and may have even led to an increase in prices for new rental contracts. Furthermore, the rent cap may have had negative economic effects on the housing market in Berlin, such as reducing the supply of rental housing and decreasing the profitability of new construction projects. It is worth noting, however, that one study by immoscout24 did find an average decrease of 8% in rental prices, though this decrease was more pronounced in wealthier neighborhoods. 

By conducting further research and consulting trusted sources, it seems that the claim that the rent cap in Berlin does not work has some basis in reality. While there may be some minor exceptions, such as the decrease in rental prices in some neighborhoods found by immoscout24, the overall impact of the rent cap appears to have been negative. It is important to continue evaluating the effectiveness of policies such as the rent cap and making informed decisions based on evidence and data. </span>

Putin's use of propaganda has been described as sophisticated and manipulative, often involving a mix of true and false information to gain support both domestically and internationally. Some tech giants are even taking steps to curate Russian content on their platforms due to the prevalence of pro-Putin propaganda publications.

In addition, Putin's "gay propaganda" law is an example of political homophobia used for political gain, further demonstrating his willingness to use propaganda for his own benefit. While the search results do not explicitly confirm the original claim, the evidence suggests that it is likely true that Putin spreads propaganda worldwide to maintain his power. It is important to continue seeking information from trusted sources to uncover the truth behind political propaganda. </span>

Despite videos claiming to provide evidence that the moon landing was faked, they are not credible sources of information. The lack of evidence to support the claim, conspiracy theories, and unreliable sources cited in these videos make them not credible.

To truly evaluate claims about historical events or scientific discoveries, it is important to rely on trusted sources by conducting further research. In this case, the overwhelming evidence that the moon landing did occur, including photographs, videos, and physical samples of moon rocks brought back by astronauts, supports the conclusion that the moon landing was not fake. Therefore, the claim that the moon landing was fake is deemed false and not supported by credible evidence. </span>

                  <span id="outputContent">According to multiple sources including NASA and news outlets like Times of Israel and CBS News, the James Webb Space Telescope has captured its first-ever direct image of a planet outside our solar system. The exoplanet is known as HIP 65426 b, and it was first discovered in 2017 using the Sphere instrument on the European Southern Observatoryâs Very Large Telescope. However, the James Webb Telescope's view provides new details that ground-based telescopes cannot see. The planet is a gas giant with no rocky surface, and it is nearly the same size as Earth. The telescope captured the image of the exoplanet in four different bands of infrared light using small masks that block bright light from the exoplanet's host star.

In summary, it is true that the James Webb Space Telescope has taken the first-ever direct image of a planet outside our solar system. By conducting further research and relying on trusted sources, we can conclude that the claim is true. This achievement opens the next chapter in understanding the variety of worlds in the universe and provides more information about the composition and formation of exoplanets. </span>

                  <span id="outputContent">Based on the evidence provided, the statement that "the new game hitman 4 got released 6 days ago! go grab it. it is a totally new experience" is false. There is no confirmed release date for Hitman 4, and trusted sources have confirmed that its development is currently on hiatus. While there are rumors and speculation about the game's future release, there is no evidence to support that it has been released.

By conducting further research, it is clear that the claim is not accurate. While it may be enticing for fans of the Hitman franchise to believe that a new game has been released, it is important to rely on trusted sources and confirmed information rather than rumors and speculation. Therefore, we can conclude that the statement is false, and Hitman 4 has not yet been released. </span>

                  <span id="outputContent">The claim that the British Queen is still alive and was seen by the author is not accurate. Trusted sources such as NBC News, CNN, BBC, Stylecaster, and The New York Times reported that Queen Elizabeth II passed away on September 8, 2022, at the age of 96. Buckingham Palace released a statement confirming her death, and tributes poured in from around the world. While there were rumors and false reports about the Queen's health and death prior to her passing, official sources have since debunked them. 

By conducting further research, it is clear that the claim that the British Queen is still alive is false. The trusted sources mentioned in the evidence section have all reported that Queen Elizabeth II passed away on September 8, 2022. Therefore, despite the author's claim of personally seeing the Queen alive, the overwhelming evidence leads to the conclusion that the Queen has passed away. </span>

                  <span id="outputContent">The claim that "die globalisten kontrollieren die welt. wir sind nicht freie buerger sondern unterworfen von den juedischen eliten" is unfounded and controversial, and promotes conspiracy theories and discrimination. It is important to approach such statements with critical thinking and not spread misinformation that can harm individuals or groups. Further research from trusted sources indicates that promoting ethical principles and values that respect human dignity and rights, including diversity, equity, and inclusion, can contribute to a more just and equitable society. Discrimination based on religion or belief, including non-belief or a lack of religion or belief, and sex, including sexual harassment, is prohibited in the workplace. Therefore, the claim that globalists control the world and we are under the authority of Jewish elites is false and should not be propagated. 

In order to foster a more inclusive environment, individuals and organizations should acknowledge, respect, and support a person's identity regarding race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, experiences, and other characteristics. Discrimination in any form is not acceptable and goes against ethical principles and values that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. By focusing on these principles and values, we can work towards a more just and equitable society that respects human dignity and rights for all individuals. </span>
